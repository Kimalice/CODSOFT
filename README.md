Predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning classifiers.
- Techniques: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings
- Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines
- Folder includes: Main code, example output images

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction
Identifies customers likely to leave a subscription-based service using historical data and predictive analytics.
- Features: Customer demographics, account info, and usage patterns
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Folder includes: Main code, output charts/graphs

### 3. Spam SMS Detection
Classifies SMS messages as spam or legitimate using NLP techniques to protect users from unwanted messages.
- Techniques: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings
- Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines
- Accuracy Achieved: 97.49%
